# The_Lopen_bot

[u/The_Lopen_bot](https://www.reddit.com/user/The_Lopen_bot/) is a chatbot active on Reddit, mainly on the subreddits r/Cremposting, r/Cosmere, r/Stormlight_Archive, r/BrandonSanderson, r/Mistborn and r/WetlanderHumor. The bot is based on the fantasy character Lopen from the series Stormlight Archive by author Brandon Sanderson.

## Basic functionalities

1. The bot's main function is to listen to comments and respond to comments containing certain keywords with random character quotes from the books, including his name, nicknames and favorite food items.
2. The bot can respond with character-specific jokes, quotes of other characters, reply to comments further up the chain with insults and praises, and praise random posts that reach the top 5 of r/cremposting's "Hot" front page. It can also respond to comments pinging it, whichever subreddit that may be.
3. The bot can detect incorrectly used spoiler tags and advice the user to correct them or remove their comment till the tags are corrected. It can also remove linked posts that have already been submitted to the subreddit, and mark posts as NSFW which have NFSV in the title.

## Web scraping

1. The bot can respond to comments with specific links in them with necessary information. For example, if a commentator links to an interview of Brandon Sanderson, the bot can scrape the entire interview, format it with spoiler tags and post it as a comment for readability and convenience.
2. When specific keywords are used, the bot can scrape the fantasy series' wiki for information and post as many paragraphs as requested of the required wiki page, or can search for interviews containing requested keywords and post them.

## File Handling

1. The bot stores all comment ids and post ids it has already replied to, comments it has skimmed, removed and restored, among others, in files so it doesn't reply/take action on the same post multiple times.
2. The bot allows members of the subreddit to join two kinds of fantasy 'factions', the Vorin Church and the Knight Radiants, with each faction having various ranks and powers. The bot handles all this through files and assigns, promotes, demotes or removes members according to either specific keywords or general verbiage in their comment histories.

## Miscellaneous

1. The bot saves posts of certain meme series (such as "Meming Every Chapter of XXX book") and updates posts on its own profile to keep record of each series.
2. The bot is sometimes used to keep record of meming contests, automatically assigning participants to teams and regularly updating their scores according to the 'upvotes' their posts get.
3. The bot is also used to create voting threads at the end of the year so people can vote for the best memes/art/comments of the year.
